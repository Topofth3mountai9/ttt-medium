# ttt-medium

I recently wrote a post about the [importance of starting small](https://medium.com/@BennettGarner/learning-python-start-small-29d15881f780) when you’re learning a new language or framework.

In that post, I suggested a bunch of tiny, throwaway experiments you could do to stop using tutorials and start coding independently in a new language.

The key insight from that post, however, was incrementalism. You learn by building something easy and then gradually making things just one level more complex. Stretch the limits of your understanding, but in manageable ways.

## tic-tac-toe

In this series of posts, I want to illustrate what I mean by incrementalism.

I think a simple game of tic-tac-toe is a good starting point.

The game itself should be pretty easy to implement. But it will also offer all kinds of opportunities for future development and complexity without getting too massive.

I’ve got all kinds of ideas for the eventual game — including creating an AI that never loses at tic-tac-toe for players to play against. Sounds fun right?

Along the way, we’ll use git for version control, test the application using pytest, maybe port it over to be playable online? There are tons of options!

But for now, we need to build the base of the game. So, let’s just build a simple version of tic-tac-toe for the command line.
